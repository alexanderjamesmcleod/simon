# Simon AI Chat: Comprehensive Development Roadmap

## Project Vision
Create a simple, powerful AI chat interface that is:
- Easily understandable
- Quickly deployable
- Robust and maintainable

## Artifacts and Reusability Strategy

### Reused Nexus Components
1. DeepSeek Model Management
   - Location: `/backend/app/ai_providers/deepseek/model_manager.py`
   - Features:
     * Multiple model type support
     * Intelligent model loading
     * Flexible response generation

2. Safe File Utilities
   - Location: `safe_file_writer.py`
   - Features:
     * Secure file reading/writing
     * Error-resistant file operations

3. Configuration Management
   - Lessons Learned:
     * Explicit environment configuration
     * Clear path and dependency management

### Development Philosophy
- Document everything
- Create rollback and recovery mechanisms
- Maintain clear, modular code structure
- Prioritize testing and error handling

## Detailed Development Phases

## Recovery and Rollback Strategy

### Documentation Requirements
For each major component, document:
1. Purpose
2. Dependencies
3. Installation steps
4. Common error scenarios
5. Rollback procedure

### Versioning and Backup
- Use semantic versioning
- Maintain clear git commit history
- Create tagged releases
- Document significant changes in CHANGELOG.md

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each component
- Integration tests
- Error scenario testing
- Performance benchmarking

## Dependency Management
- Use virtual environments
- Pin exact versions
- Create comprehensive requirements files
- Document installation process for different environments

## Monitoring and Observability
- Implement logging
- Create health check endpoints
- Design performance tracking

## Community and Contribution
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Code of conduct
- Easy onboarding process

## Long-term Vision
Simon is not just a chat interface, but a learning platform that evolves with user needs and technological advancements.
